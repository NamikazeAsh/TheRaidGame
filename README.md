# TheRaidGame
Java based code / plugin made for Minecraft , manually coded by @NamikazeAsh

# About TRG / The Raid Game
The plugin focuses on implementing an archetype of a survival based mode in Minecraft by adding two different modes in the plugin
1. Speedrun mode
2. Endless mode

The objective of this plugin is to give the players a danger to escape from while completing an objective based on the mode chosen
Mode details are mentioned further below

Alongside these 2 gamemodes , there are difficulties for the given modes 
1. Easy
2. Medium
3. Hard
4. Hell

Each difficulty level increases the armor/changes the armor on the mobs , and in some cases making them way way tougher to fight by adding enchantments and effects to the mobs. 

# Speedrun Mode
Ever wanted a challenging mode while trying to complete the gamemode?
Well , here's your chance to defeat the ender dragon while being chased by raid mobs , these raid mobs would be spawning in waves and these waves' would have a certain composition of mobs with a Ravager spawning at continous intervals.

# Endless Mode
Ever wanted a gamemode in minecraft to play where you have to test your survival skills (literally!) by surviving against a huge horde of mobs spawning near you alongside bosses?
Here ya go , this mode presents an unlimited amount of spawns with the mere objective being **SURVIVE**
